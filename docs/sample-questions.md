### 問題文

Read the following passage and answer the question below.

**Climate Change and Its Impact**

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. The Earth's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century, primarily due to increased carbon dioxide emissions and other human activities. This warming trend is causing significant changes to our environment, including rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and shifts in wildlife populations and habitats.

Scientists warn that if we continue on our current path, the consequences could be severe. Coastal cities may face flooding, agricultural productivity could decline in many regions, and millions of people may be displaced due to climate-related disasters. However, there is still hope. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting natural ecosystems, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

**Question**: According to the passage, what are the main causes of climate change, and what solutions does the author suggest?

### 参考解答

The main cause of climate change mentioned in the passage is increased carbon dioxide emissions and other human activities. The author suggests three main solutions: transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting natural ecosystems.

## 問題4: 長文読解（ビジネス）

**難易度**: Hard  
**配点**: 25点  
**問題タイプ**: 記述式

### 問題文

Read the following business scenario and answer the questions below.

**The Digital Transformation Challenge**

TechCorp, a traditional manufacturing company with 50 years of history, is facing increasing pressure from digitally native competitors. While the company has maintained steady profits through its established client relationships, recent market research indicates that younger customers prefer to purchase products online with same-day delivery options—services that TechCorp currently does not offer.

The CEO has proposed a comprehensive digital transformation strategy that would require a $50 million investment over three years. This plan includes building an e-commerce platform, implementing AI-driven supply chain management, and retraining the existing workforce. However, the board of directors is divided. Some members argue that the investment is too risky and could jeopardize the company's financial stability. Others believe that failing to adapt could result in the company becoming obsolete within a decade.

The CFO has presented two options:
1. **Aggressive Transformation**: Invest the full $50 million immediately, potentially capturing market share quickly but risking short-term financial strain.
2. **Gradual Approach**: Phase the investment over five years with $10 million annually, reducing financial risk but potentially losing competitive advantage.

**Questions**:
1. What is the main challenge facing TechCorp?
2. What are the risks and benefits of each proposed option?
3. If you were advising the CEO, which approach would you recommend and why?

### 参考解答

1. **Main Challenge**: TechCorp is facing pressure from digitally native competitors because it lacks online purchasing and same-day delivery services that younger customers demand, despite having 50 years of established business relationships.

2. **Risks and Benefits**:
   - **Aggressive Transformation**:
     - Benefits: Quick market share capture, faster competitive response
     - Risks: Short-term financial strain, potential instability
   
   - **Gradual Approach**:
     - Benefits: Reduced financial risk, more manageable implementation
     - Risks: Potential loss of competitive advantage, may become obsolete before completion

3. **Recommendation**: (答えは複数あり得る。論理的であればOK)
   Example: "I would recommend a modified aggressive approach, investing $35-40 million in the first two years focused on the e-commerce platform and supply chain, while spreading workforce retraining over the full three years. This balances speed with financial prudence."

### 採点基準

- 課題の正確な理解: 8点
- 両方の選択肢の分析: 10点
- 論理的な推奨と根拠: 7点

## 問題5: 記述問題（意見）

**難易度**: Hard  
**配点**: 20点  
**問題タイプ**: 記述式（自由記述）

### 問題文

Write a short paragraph (100-150 words) expressing your opinion on the following statement:

**"Remote work should become the standard for all office jobs, not just an option."**

Include:
- Your position (agree or disagree)
- At least two reasons supporting your position
- One potential counterargument and your response to it

### 採点基準

| 項目 | 配点 |
|:---|:---|
| 明確な立場表明 | 4点 |
| 2つ以上の理由と具体例 | 8点 |
| 反論への対応 | 4点 |
| 文法・語彙の適切さ | 4点 |

### 参考解答例（賛成の立場）

I agree that remote work should become the standard for office jobs. First, it significantly improves work-life balance by eliminating long commutes, allowing employees to spend more time with family or on personal development. Second, companies can reduce overhead costs such as office rent and utilities while accessing a global talent pool. Some argue that remote work hinders collaboration and company culture. However, modern communication tools like video conferencing and project management software effectively bridge this gap, and many studies show that remote workers are actually more productive than their office-based counterparts.

### 参考解答例（反対の立場）

While remote work offers benefits, I disagree that it should be the standard for all office jobs. Face-to-face interaction is crucial for creative collaboration, spontaneous brainstorming, and building strong team relationships that cannot be replicated through screens. Additionally, not all employees have suitable home environments for productive work, and some people struggle with self-discipline without office structure. Proponents claim remote work increases productivity, but this varies greatly by individual and industry. A hybrid model would be more appropriate, allowing flexibility while maintaining the advantages of in-person collaboration for tasks that truly benefit from physical presence.
